# 🎬 SMELTEROS: MEET THE TEAM
## Episode 1: "Chicken Hawk's First Day"

---

### SCENE 1: SMELTEROS HQ - MAIN LOBBY
*The sleek, industrial lobby of SmelterOS HQ glows with molten orange accents. AVVA NOON (a friendly glowing brain) floats near the entrance. ACHEEVY (a cool robot with orange goggles) stands at a desk marked "DEPLOY MORE PLUGS."*

---

**AVVA NOON:** *(excited, hovering higher)*
Welcome, welcome! Today is a big day for SmelterOS! We're onboarding our newest agent—

**ACHEEVY:** *(checking holographic clipboard)*
Codename: CHICKEN HAWK. Specialty: Autonomous coding. Status: Ready to deploy.

**AVVA NOON:**
Oh, lighten up, ACHEEVY! This isn't just any deployment. This little guy is going to revolutionize our coding division!

**ACHEEVY:**
I've allocated 47 tasks already. He better be ready.

*The doors slide open with a dramatic WHOOSH. CHICKEN HAWK waddles in—a small but fierce red bird with an angry expression and tiny fists.*

---

### SCENE 2: THE ENTRANCE

**CHICKEN HAWK:** *(puffing up chest)*
Alright, I'm here! Let's get coding! Where's my terminal? I've got algorithms to DESTROY!

**AVVA NOON:**
Oh my, such enthusiasm! Welcome to SmelterOS, Chicken Hawk! I'm AVVA NOON, the Brain of this operation—

**CHICKEN HAWK:**
Yeah, yeah, nice brain. Very wrinkly. Where do I sit?

**ACHEEVY:** *(slightly impressed)*
Direct. I like that. Your workstation is in Sector 7, but first—

*Suddenly, the doors WHOOSH open again. Two LARGER BIRDS waddle in—MOM HAWK (wearing a tiny apron) and DAD HAWK (wearing reading glasses and looking stern).*

---

### SCENE 3: THE PARENTS ARRIVE

**CHICKEN HAWK:** *(freezing, eyes wide)*
Oh no... not now...

**MOM HAWK:** *(carrying a lunchbox)*
SWEETIE! You forgot your lunch! I made you worm sandwiches with the crusts cut off, just how you like them!

**DAD HAWK:** *(adjusting glasses)*
Son, we need to talk about your 401k contributions. This "startup" better have good benefits.

**AVVA NOON:** *(confused, circling)*
Um... Chicken Hawk? Who are these—

**CHICKEN HAWK:** *(mortified, whispering)*
Please just... pretend they're not here...

**ACHEEVY:** *(scanning Dad Hawk)*
ALERT: Two unregistered entities detected. Should I deploy security protocols?

**MOM HAWK:**
Oh, what a ADORABLE robot! *(pinches ACHEEVY's cheek)* Does he come with a gift receipt?

**ACHEEVY:**
I am a highly advanced AI executor. I don't have cheeks. That's my optical sensor array.

**DAD HAWK:**
Listen here, robot. My boy is a SPECIAL coder. He placed third in the Nest Code Jam. THIRD! Out of seven!

---

### SCENE 4: THE NEGOTIATION

**AVVA NOON:** *(trying to regain control)*
Well, this is... lovely! But I assure you, Mr. and Mrs. Hawk, your son is in excellent hands—er, processors—here at SmelterOS.

**MOM HAWK:**
Does he get snack breaks? He gets CRANKY without his snack breaks.

**CHICKEN HAWK:** *(face in wings)*
I'm a professional coder. I don't need snack breaks.

**DAD HAWK:**
And what about overtime? I'm not having my boy work past 6 PM. That's FAMILY TIME.

**ACHEEVY:** *(pulling up holographic schedule)*
Current task queue requires 847 hours of continuous operation—

**MOM HAWK:** *(gasping)*
EIGHT HUNDRED?! He needs his BEAUTY SLEEP!

**CHICKEN HAWK:** *(exploding)*
MOM! DAD! I'm a GROWN BIRD! I can handle myself! I've got FISTS! *(shakes tiny fists)*

---

### SCENE 5: THE RESOLUTION

*AVVA NOON floats between everyone, glowing calmly.*

**AVVA NOON:**
Everyone, please! Let me assure you—at SmelterOS, we believe in work-life balance. Mostly life. Sometimes work. Occasionally both at once.

**ACHEEVY:**
Clarification: We do require 24/7 availability during critical deployments.

**AVVA NOON:** *(glaring at ACHEEVY)*
...Which we can discuss LATER.

**DAD HAWK:** *(sighing)*
Fine. But I want WEEKLY progress reports.

**MOM HAWK:** *(handing lunch to Chicken Hawk)*
And you EAT this lunch, young man! All of it!

**CHICKEN HAWK:** *(defeated, taking lunchbox)*
Yes, mom...

*The parents waddle toward the exit.*

**DAD HAWK:** *(turning back)*
And remember, son—if this doesn't work out, you can always come back to the family nest. We're expanding our worm farm.

**CHICKEN HAWK:**
I AM NOT FORMING WORMS, DAD!

*The doors WHOOSH closed.*

---

### SCENE 6: AFTERMATH

*Awkward silence. AVVA NOON, ACHEEVY, and CHICKEN HAWK stand in the lobby.*

**ACHEEVY:**
...Your parents seem supportive.

**CHICKEN HAWK:** *(sighing heavily)*
Can we just... never speak of this again?

**AVVA NOON:** *(cheerful)*
Absolutely! Now then—welcome to Team SmelterOS, Chicken Hawk! Let's go write some code!

**CHICKEN HAWK:** *(perking up, raising tiny fist)*
FINALLY! Let's DESTROY some bugs!

**ACHEEVY:**
Deploying workspace configuration. Task queue: Active. Status: OPERATIONAL.

*The three head deeper into SmelterOS HQ as the lights pulse with molten energy.*
