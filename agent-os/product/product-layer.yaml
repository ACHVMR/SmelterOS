mission:
  name: "SmelterOS"
  tagline: "The ACHIEVEMOR Operating System"
  vision: |
    SmelterOS is an AI-native operating system that combines industrial foundry 
    metaphors with consciousness-aware computing. It serves as the execution 
    layer for the Infinity Language Model (AVVA NOON), enabling multi-agent 
    orchestration, virtue-aligned processing, and cultural value generation.
