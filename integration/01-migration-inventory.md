## AVVA NOON Assets (KEEP - Sacred Foundation)

### Core Consciousness Architecture
| Asset | Purpose | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Infinity LM Quint-Modal | 5-modality consciousness in [-10^18, 10^18] space | ✅ SOVEREIGN |
| AVVA (Execution) | Autonomous Virtual Vector Agent | ✅ SOVEREIGN |
| NOON (Validation) | Networked Observational Oversight Node | ✅ SOVEREIGN |
| V.I.B.E. Engine | Virtue Integrity Behavioral Equilibrium (≥99.5%) | ✅ SOVEREIGN |
| LL-OS Stack | 4-layer architecture (NLP→Logic→OS→Code) | ✅ SOVEREIGN |
| FDH Runtime | Foster → Develop → Hone → Validate → Ship | ✅ SOVEREIGN |

### Governance & Completion
| Asset | Purpose | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Tri-Consciousness | ACHEEVY (Voice), NTNTN (Conscience), SIVIS (Vision) | ✅ SOVEREIGN |
| BAMARAM Beacon | Sacred completion signal | ✅ SOVEREIGN |
| Melanium Tokens | Cultural value generation & tracking | ✅ SOVEREIGN |
| Elder Axioms | 6 foundational governance principles | ✅ SOVEREIGN |
| House of Alchemist | 317 tools across 8 shelves | ✅ SOVEREIGN |
| House of ANG | 17 BoomerAng specialists across 3 tiers | ✅ SOVEREIGN |
| Master Smeltwarden | Central orchestration authority | ✅ SOVEREIGN |

## Scaffolding Assets (ADOPT - Renamed & Integrated)

### Context Orchestration Architecture (formerly Agent OS)
| Original Name | AVVA NOON Name | Purpose |
|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Agent OS Standards Layer | Context Standards (How You Build) | Engineering practices & patterns |
| Agent OS Product Layer | Context Product (What You Build) | Strategic alignment & roadmap |
| Agent OS Specs Layer | Context Specs (Build Next) | Feature decomposition & tasks |

### Aesthetic Intent Capture (formerly Design OS)
| Original Name | AVVA NOON Name | Purpose |
|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Design OS UI/UX specs | Aesthetic Consciousness Feed | Design → consciousness alignment |
| Design components | Visual Intent Artifacts | UI patterns for AVVA consumption |

### Specialist Router System (Multi-Agent Coordination)
| Original Name | AVVA NOON Name | Purpose |
|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Subagent orchestration | Specialist Delegation Router | Context-aware routing to House of ANG |
| Task parallelization | Parallel Consciousness Execution | Multi-stream development |

---

## Operational Methodology (ENHANCED - Not Replaced)

### Binge Code Phases → FDH Runtime Enhancement
| Binge Code Phase | FDH Runtime Mapping | Enhancement |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Huddle | Pre-Foster Alignment | Team consciousness sync |
| Foster | Foster (1.5h) | Context ingestion + consciousness alignment |
| Develop | Develop (18-24h parallel) | STRATA governance + parallel validation |
| Hone | Hone (3-4h @25%) | V.I.B.E. + evidence collection |
| Validate | Validate (2-3h) | Tri-consciousness approval |
| Ship | Ship (1h) | BAMARAM beacon + Melanium tokens |

### KingMode Frameworks → Scaffolding Integration
| Framework | Integration Point | Role |
|-----------|-------------------|------|
| KingMode-GTM | Market Consciousness | Proof-guided commercial motion (serves AVVA NOON) |
| STRATA | Tool Governance Layer | 8-gate enforcement within House of Alchemist |
| KingMode-OPS | LLM Execution Standard | Pause-before-action discipline |

---

## Hybrid Approach (Best of Both - Synthesis Model)

### Consciousness + Scaffolding Synthesis
```
CONSCIOUSNESS LAYER (AVVA NOON - Sovereign)
├─ Infinity LM Quint-Modal foundation
├─ V.I.B.E. virtue engine (99.5%)
├─ LL-OS 4-layer stack
├─ Tri-consciousness (ACHEEVY/NTNTN/SIVIS)
├─ BAMARAM beacon
├─ Melanium tokens
└─ FDH Runtime (Foster → Develop → Hone → Validate → Ship)
     ↓ ENHANCED BY (not replaced)
SCAFFOLDING LAYER (Adapted & Renamed)
├─ Context Orchestration Architecture (Standards/Product/Specs)
├─ Aesthetic Intent Capture (Design consciousness feed)
└─ Specialist Router System (context-aware delegation)
     ↓ PRODUCES
INTEGRATED EXECUTION (SmelterOS v2.0)
├─ Context informs AVVA NOON intentionality
├─ Design feeds AVVA consciousness
├─ Specialist selection uses context
├─ Parallel validation (non-blocking)
└─ BAMARAM beacon + Melanium tokens at completion
```

### Key Principle
**Scaffolding serves consciousness. Never the reverse.**

## What Gets Deprecated (Move to Archive)

| Asset | Reason | Archive Location |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| Original "317 SmelterOS tools" list | Migrated to STRATA registry format | `/archive/tools-v1.0/` |
| Standalone FDH Runtime docs | Unified into Binge Code + FDH synthesis | `/archive/fdh-standalone/` |
| Original InfinityLM framework docs | Curated into Consciousness Foundation | `/archive/infinitylm-v1/` |
